## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<h1> Tharanginy Muhunthan</h1>
            <p class="paragraph"> Hello! Iâ€™m Tharanginy, a recent Chemistry with Mathematics graduate from UCL, with experience in data analysis using Excel, Python, and Stata. Iâ€™m particularly passionate about using data-driven insights to tackle real-world problems. <br><br>During my degree, I developed and documented Python code to improve efficiency and accuracy in laboratory analysis, while also honing key skills in scientific reporting and data interpretation. I completed an internship at AWE, where I deepened my technical expertise by modelling reaction chemistry using computational tools, presenting findings to stakeholders, and collaborating effectively within a team.<br><br>As a private tutor, I explain complex mathematical and scientific concepts with clarity, and my experience in retail has further strengthened my interpersonal and communication skills.<br><br> </p>
